You are given an array 'arr' sorted in non-decreasing order and a number 'x'.
You must return the index of lower bound of 'x'.

// answer we are returing is index of element which is equal or smaller than x which is a value.
public class Solution {
    public static int lowerBound(int []arr, int n, int x) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        int ans = n;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            // maybe an answer
            if (arr[mid] >= x) {
                ans = mid;
                //look for smaller index on the left
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1; // look on the right
            }
        }
        return ans;
     }
