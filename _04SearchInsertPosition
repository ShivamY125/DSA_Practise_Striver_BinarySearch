We have to return the index where the given no x can be adjusted inside the array .
EX if arr = [1,2,3,4,7] and x  = 6 we can insert 6 at index 4 after the index 3 where there is 4.

// Code for this is:-  

public class Solution {
    public static int searchInsert(int [] arr, int x){
        // Write your code here.
        int low = 0;
        int high  =arr.length-1;
        int ans  = arr.length;

        while(low<=high){
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;

            if(arr[mid]>=x){
                ans = mid;
                high = mid-1;
            }else 
                  low = mid+1;
        }
       return ans;
    }
}
