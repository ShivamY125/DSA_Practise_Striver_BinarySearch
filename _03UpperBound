You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ containing ‘n’ integers and an integer ‘x’.
Implement the ‘upperBound’ function to find the index of the upper bound of 'x' in the array.


public class Solution {
    public static int upperBound(int []arr, int x, int n){
        // Write your code here.
        int low = 0;
        int high = n-1;
        int ans = n;

        while(low<=high){
            int mid = (low + high)/2;
// the only change here in upper bound in we are not taking >= we are only taking >. so that we get upperbound of the x.
            if(arr[mid]> x){
                ans = mid;
                high = mid-1;
            }else
             low = mid+1;
        }


     return ans;





    }
}
